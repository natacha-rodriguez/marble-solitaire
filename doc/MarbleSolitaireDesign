Marble Solitaire Design

Approach chosen: Genetic Algorithm.
Reasons:
- The problem has too many possible paths to implement an heuristic function.
- This kind of algorithm works well for search problems.

Individual:
- The genotype or individual to use will be a set of specific weights given to the board cells, which are grouped into classes according to the simmetry to the center:

    a b a
    c d c
a c e f e c a
b d f g f b d
a c e f e c a
	c d c
	a b a

- each weight represents how desirable is a peg on that cell, so cells with less weight will be cleaned up first.
	
Fitness:
- The chosen fitness function will be the quantity of pegs still on the board when there are no more possible moves. The ideal fitness is 1 (because of the peg in the middle).
- To calculate the fitness funtion, each individual will be evaluated the following way:
1. For all the possible moves, calculate the sum of all the weights for all set cells after making the move.
2. For the move with the bigger weight, repeat step 1. Go on this way until the quantity of set pegs is equal to the change of criteria setting
3. When the change of criteria is reached, then make a prioritized search for the best fitness reachable by this path. Euristic used is also the total weight of the board.


Next Generation:
- The next generation will change in just one individual, generated by the combination of the two with better fitness.
- The new individual will replace one of the ones with worse fitness
